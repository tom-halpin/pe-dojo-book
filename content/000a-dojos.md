## Dojos

This book's roots lie in a number of interactive enablement dojos which developed open sourced in order to share with the wider community.

### DevOps Dojos

DevOps Dojos became popular after Target, an important U.S.-based retail company, introduced the practice back in support of its DevOps transformation. Since then, multiple conference talks, white papers and books have been published about DevOps Dojos. People relate to and like the dojo experience, and to this day the on-site experience still leads to great results. However there is a scalability issue: it is often not possible to accommodate everyone that needs or wants to be accommodated in face to face dojos. To address scalability issues interactive browser based DevOps Dojo's have been developed. The Dojo model has also been applied to other domains including Product Engineering.

### Product Engineering Dojo

A business's customer-centric approach can be better facilitated by the judicious application of Product Engineering, underpinned by Agile and DevOps principles. As a result many companies are investing in helping customer-facing teams adopt new approaches like Product Engineering to increase their agility, collaboration and responsiveness to customer needs.

Product Engineering embraces concepts of design thinking, which aims to create better products and services by understanding how users interact with them and the conditions under which they are to operate. It emphasizes bidirectional communication, feedback loops, learning from mistakes and experiential approaches.

However training is needed to help people make the cultural shift from a project mindset to a product mindset. This book is intended to help address that training need, the objective being to help people ensure the software applications and integrations they develop, as well as the managed services they provide, are better suited to the needs of the business and the demands of the market.

### Open Sourcing

This open sourced eBook **Product Engineering An Introduction** is intended to help:

- Help raise awareness of Product Engineering.

- Prepare people a face-to-face or virtual Product Engineering Dojos and / or Design Thinking Workshops by learning associated techniques in advance.

- Provide a Product Engineering curriculum in a format that allows students to access and to consume the curriculum as and when they need it.

- Share what "good looks like" when answering enquiries in relation to Product Engineering and / or Design Thinking patterns.

### Universal Imports - A Story

One of our ongoing challenges as coaches is to make the learning experience engaging. There is nothing better than a good story to engage people, so we created one to support our training.

The Product Engineering Dojo tells the story of a fictitious group of companies, the "Universal Imports Group" and its employees as they embark on their Product Engineering journey. You will meet those employees in subsequent chapters, share their journey and hopefully gain some insights that will help you in your own Product Engineering journey.
