## Dojos

This book's roots lie in a number of interactive enablement dojos which were developed and in time open sourced to share with the wider community.

### DevOps Dojos

DevOps Dojos gained popularity after Target, a major U.S. retail company, introduced the practice to support its DevOps transformation. Since then, numerous conference talks, white papers, and books have explored DevOps Dojos.

The dojo experience resonates with many, consistently delivering impressive results through on-site sessions. However, scalability remains a challenge, as it's often impractical to accommodate everyone in face-to-face dojos. To overcome this, interactive browser-based DevOps Dojos have been developed. Additionally, the Dojo model has been extended to other domains, including Product Engineering.

### Product Engineering Dojo

A business's customer-centric approach to software development can be better facilitated by the judicious application of Product Engineering, underpinned by Agile and DevOps principles. As a result many companies are investing in helping customer-facing teams adopt new approaches like Product Engineering to increase their agility, collaboration and responsiveness to customer needs.

Product Engineering embraces concepts of design thinking, which aims to create better products and services by understanding how users interact with them and the conditions under which they are to operate. It emphasizes bidirectional communication, feedback loops, learning from mistakes and experiential approaches.

However, training is essential to facilitate the cultural shift from a project mindset to a product mindset. This book aims to address that training need, with the objective of helping individuals ensure that the software applications and integrations they develop, along with the managed services they provide, are "productized" and thus better aligned with business needs and market demands.

"Productization" being the process of transforming a service, solution, or internal tool into a standardized product that can be consistently replicated, marketed, and sold. This typically involves defining clear features, creating a user-friendly interface, establishing support systems, and setting pricing models, thereby making the offering accessible to a broader market. The goal of "productization" is to create a scalable and repeatable product that meets specific customer needs and can be offered to multiple clients without extensive customization for each one.

### Open Sourcing

This open-sourced eBook, **Product Engineering An Introduction**, is designed to:

- Raise awareness of Product Engineering.

- Prepare individuals for face-to-face or virtual Product Engineering Dojos and Design Thinking Workshops by teaching associated techniques in advance.

- Offer a Product Engineering curriculum in a flexible format, allowing students to access and consume the material as needed.

- Share best practices for addressing inquiries related to Product Engineering and Design Thinking patterns.

### Universal Imports - A Story

One of our ongoing challenges as coaches is to make the learning experience engaging. There is nothing better than a good story to engage people, so we created one to support our training.

The Product Engineering Dojo tells the story of a fictitious group of companies, the "Universal Imports Group" and its employees as they embark on their Product Engineering journey. You will meet those employees shorty, share their journey and hopefully gain some insights that will help you in your own Product Engineering journey.
