## Dojos

This eBook's roots lie in a number of interactive Dojos DXC developed to train it's own employees and then open sourced in order to share with the wider community.

### DevOps Dojos

DevOps Dojos became popular since Target, an important U.S.-based retail company, started to introduce such a practice back in 2014 in support of its DevOps transformation. Since then, multiple conference talks, white papers and books have been published about DevOps Dojos.

DXC have been running DevOps Dojos for own employees and customers for some time, however we quickly came to a point where our physical DevOps Dojos were not enough to cover all the needs. Everyone was loving the experience, and to this day the on-site experience still leads to great results. But we had a scalability issue: we could not accommodate everyone we needed to address so we developed an interactive browser based DevOps Dojo for our staff.

Following the success of that effort we released an open source version of our DevOps Dojo - the [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo).

In parallel we continued to apply the Dojo model to other problem domains.

### Product Engineering Dojo

DXCâ€™s customer-centric approach is facilitated by the judicious application of product engineering, underpinned by Agile and DevOps principles.

As a result DXC invests heavily in helping customer-facing teams adopt new approaches like Product Engineering to increase their agility, collaboration and responsiveness to customer needs.

Product engineering embraces concepts of design thinking, which aims to create better products and services by understanding how users interact with them and the conditions under which they are to operate. It emphasizes bidirectional communication, feedback loops, learning from mistakes and experiential approaches.

DXC wanted to provide training to help our people make the cultural shift from a project mindset to a product mindset, to do so we created an interactive browser based **Product Engineering Dojo**. The objective being to help ensure the software applications and integrations we develop, as well as the managed services we provide, are better suited to the needs of the business and the demands of the market.

### Open Sourcing

We use the **Product Engineering Dojo** to:

- Train people at scale on Product Engineering.
- Help people prepare for a face-to-face or virtual Product Engineering Dojo or Design Thinking Workshop by learning techniques in advance.
- Provide a product engineering curriculum with interactive modules.
- Provide a browser based way to allow students get knowledge when they need it.
- Share what "good looks like" when answering enquiries in relation to Product Engineering  or Design Thinking patterns
- Following on from the success of the [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo) - continue to leverage the story and the characters by extending the story and thus create more learning experiences in effect creating the Pet Clinic multi-verse.

To continue giving something back to the community we also released an open source version of our Product Engineering Dojo - the [Online Product Engineering Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-pe-dojo).

### Universal Imports - A Story

Our challenge as coaches was to make the experience engaging. There is nothing better than a good story to engage people, so we created one to support the training.

The dojo tells the story of a fictitious group of companies, the "Universal Imports Group" and its employees on their Product Engineering journey. You will meet those employees in subsequent chapters, share their journeys and hopefully gain some insights from those journeys that will help you in your own Product Engineering journey.
