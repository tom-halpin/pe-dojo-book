# Preface

Humans love stories, the urge to tell stories is in our DNA.

This book is the novelization of an interactive Product Engineering Dojo which took a role-based story telling approach to help achieve hands-on learning at scale.

**Product Engineering An Introduction** is set in the **Pet Clinic** multi-verse. The aim being to place learners in real-world-like scenarios, where they interact with a virtual cast of characters sharing the challenges and aspirations of the team as they learn about Product Engineering.

## About the Author

Tom has experience of a variety of sectors including factory automation, supply chain & logistics, lecturing, eLearning & training and finance where he has performed a variety of roles from software development to technical management.
