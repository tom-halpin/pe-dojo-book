# Preface

Humans have an innate love for stories; the urge to tell them is embedded in our DNA.

This book is the novelization of an interactive Product Engineering Dojo, which utilized a role-based storytelling approach to facilitate large-scale, hands-on learning.

**Product Engineering An Introduction** is set in the **Pet Clinic** multiverse. Its goal is to immerse readers and learners in realistic scenarios where they engage with a virtual cast of characters, experiencing the team's challenges and aspirations as they delve into the world of Product Engineering.

## About the Author

Tom Halpin works in a DevOps enablement role helping teams to transform how they work to a DevOps model in support of product aligned value streams; to facilitate the scaled adaption of the associated culture, practices and tools. Tom has experience of a variety of sectors including factory automation, supply chain & logistics, lecturing, eLearning & training and finance where he has performed a variety of roles from software development to technical management.

Tom believes product engineering can help teams achieve greater speed by recognizing the importance of occasionally slowing down. Teams need to understand this and invest in the right mix of product features and work practices. By doing so, they can optimize their value stream and reduce technical and operational debt, ultimately achieving greater success.
