# Preface

Humans have an innate love for stories; the urge to tell them is embedded in our DNA.

This book is the novelization of an online interactive **Product Engineering Dojo**, which utilized a role-based storytelling approach to facilitate large-scale, hands-on learning.

**Product Engineering An Introduction** is set in the **Pet Clinic** multiverse. Its goal is to immerse readers and learners in realistic scenarios where they engage with a virtual cast of characters, experiencing the team's challenges and sharing in the team's aspirations as they delve into the world of Product Engineering.

## About the Author

Tom Halpin works in a DevOps enablement role, helping teams transition to a DevOps model to support product-aligned value streams. His goal is to facilitate the scaled adoption of the associated culture, practices, and tools. Tom brings a wealth of experience across various sectors, including factory automation, supply chain & logistics, lecturing, eLearning & training, and finance. He has held a wide range of roles from software development to technical management.

Tom believes that product engineering can help teams achieve greater speed by recognizing the importance of occasionally slowing down. Teams need to understand this balance and invest in the right mix of product features and work practices. By doing so, they can optimize their value stream, reduce technical and operational debt, and ultimately achieve greater success.

## Foreword

_The progression of information technology (IT) over the past three decades has underscored the fundamental reality that organizations must effectively leverage the advantages of technology's evolution. However, this still depends upon Human Resources, Processes, and Technology._

_However, human resources and processes must evolve in harmony. While the influence of teamwork and adopting agile methodologies in software development are well-documented and widely acknowledged, extending these principles across the broader IT landscape has proven to be a complex challenge. The transition to a Product Engineering operating model represents a journey requiring deliberate and strategic steps._

_A notable obstacle to this transition is the misinterpretation of team roles. Merely designating an individual as a scrum master or a product owner is insufficient. While these roles are pivotal, a more comprehensive understanding of their interactions and functions is often required. Enter "Product Engineering" and its innovative approach to delineating these roles and functions through a unique, multi-verse (Pet Clinic) experience. This method renders corporate roles relatable and applies a straightforward yet potent set of proven techniques, thereby elucidating the complexities of product engineering and informing the audience._

_This publication is designed to cater to all levels within a corporate hierarchy, from product owners, managers, and executives seeking to deepen their understanding to development team members aiming to refine their practices. Its simple yet creative approach imparts invaluable knowledge and insights into modern techniques that have the potential to revolutionize one's approach to product development. Each role is recognized for its unique contribution, making this a truly inclusive resource._

_As you delve into the second edition of this publication, get ready for a transformative journey. The wisdom encapsulated within these pages is not just theoretical, but practical, poised to redefine how product development is approached. It equips individuals with the tools and comprehension required to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of IT. This prospect should inspire and invigorate individuals, sparking excitement about the potential changes it can bring to their approach._
